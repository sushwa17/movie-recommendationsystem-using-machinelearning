The Movie Recommendation System Using Machine Learning is a Flask-based web application designed to help users discover movies they are likely to enjoy. The project leverages the MovieLens 32M dataset, which contains millions of ratings and metadata such as movie titles, genres, and tags.  Our system follows a content-based filtering approach.
